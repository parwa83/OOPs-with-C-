This repository contains my hands-on implementation of core Object-Oriented Programming concepts in C++, written for learning, practice, and clarity.

The code covers fundamental OOP principles such as classes and objects, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, constructors/destructors, and basic memory handling, with simple and readable examples.

The focus is on understanding concepts through code, not on over-engineering. Each example is kept minimal so that the behavior of OOP principles is easy to observe and modify.

This repository serves as:

A personal learning archive

A quick revision resource

A reference for beginners exploring OOP in C++
